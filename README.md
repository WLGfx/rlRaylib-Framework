# rlRaylib-Framework
Building a framework/engine for Raylib.

For starters, this is my first go at raylib and I very much like it. For this reason I've decided to explore in depth the creation of my own rendering pipeline or whatever they call it and make it super easy to use.

# GUI update

I've c++'ified the raygui implemention after deciding to stick with it for simplicities sake.

TODO: 
1. add more gui functionality
2. c++'ify some other sections
3. test. test. test.
